        <Description>
            Tests copy propagation optimization pass of JIT compiler.
            Test contains var1=var2 assignment. 
            Variable var1 is changed in some dispatch node after var1=var2. 
            Checks that the value of var1 is correct, 
            i.e. that copy doesn’t propagated further if var1 change its value.
