        <Description>
            Tests copy propagation optimization pass of JIT compiler.
            Test contains i=j assignment. Variable i is static class variable. 
            It is changed in a native method after i=j. 
            Checks that the value of i is changed, 
            i.e. that copy isn’t propagated over native code.
