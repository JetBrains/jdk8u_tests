        <Description>
            Tests lazyexc optimization of JIT compiler.
            Checks that lazyexc isn't performed if exception class implements finalize() method which has side-effect.
            Test case details:
            Test throws and catches TestException in a loop.
            TestException class implements finalize() method 
            which changes the value of the static boolean test class field from 'false' to 'true'.
            System.runFinalization() method is called after the loop.
            Checks by the class field value that finalize() method execution was executed, 
            which means that TestException object was created, i.e. lazyexc wasn’t performed.
