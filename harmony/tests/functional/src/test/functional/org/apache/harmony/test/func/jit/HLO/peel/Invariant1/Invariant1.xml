        <Description>
            Tests loop peeling optimization of JIT compiler.
            Test contains a loop and some loop invariant value calculated several 
            times inside the loop, but following loop dependent code refers to it. 
            Test checks that loop invariant isn’t hoisted than, because it would 
            erroneously have last determined value.
