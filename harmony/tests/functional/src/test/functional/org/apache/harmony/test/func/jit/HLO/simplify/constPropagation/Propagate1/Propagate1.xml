        <Description>
            Tests constant propagation optimization pass of JIT compiler.
            Test contains s=Const assignment. Variable s is static class variable. 
            It is changed in a native method after s=Const. 
            Checks that the value of s is changed, 
            i.e. that constant isn’t propagated over native code.
