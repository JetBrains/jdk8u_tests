        <Description>
		Java class creates a lot of threads. Each thread calls its
		native method. Native method calls itself
		with CallVoidMethod() JNI function specified number of times
		(enough to cause stack oveflow). Then the method catches
		StackOverflowError and then raises an exception which
		is caught within the same method. Then the same exception
		object is thrown to upper level.
		Parameters:
			-fillMemory - 0 - do not pad memory, 1 - pad memory (0 by default)
			-threads - number of threads (100 by default)
			-timeout - timeout to wait threads to die (ms) (20 minutes by default)
